                       <li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
                      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>

                 <h3>Steps:</h3>
                 <ol>
                     <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.</li>
                     <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
                     <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
                     <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                      <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</li>
                      <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and spread it out evenly.</li>
                      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
                     <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
                      <li>Once cooled, frost the cakes with your favorite frosting or serve them plain.</li>
