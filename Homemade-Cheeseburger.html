                 <h3>Steps:</h3>
                 <ol>
                     <li>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and shape them into patties. Season both sides of each patty with salt and pepper.</li>
                     <li>Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
                     <li>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty and cover the skillet or grill to melt the cheese.</li>
                     <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until lightly golden.</li>
                     <li>Assemble the burgers by placing a cooked patty with melted cheese on the bottom half of each bun.</li>
                     <li>Top with lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, onions, pickles (if using), and condiments like ketchup and mustard.</li>
                     <li>Cover with the top half of the bun and serve immediately.</li>
                    </ol>
