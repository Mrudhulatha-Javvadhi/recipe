                 <h3>Steps:</h3>
                 <ol>
                     <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the granulated sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt.</li>
                     <li>Gradually whisk in the whole milk until smooth.</li>
                     <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                     <li>Once boiling, continue to cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
                      <li>In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks. Gradually whisk in about 1 cup of the hot cocoa mixture to temper the eggs.</li>
                     <li>Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cocoa mixture, whisking constantly.</li>
                     <li>Cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the pudding is thickened.</li>
                      <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the unsalted butter and vanilla extract until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
                      <li>Transfer the pudding to serving dishes or a large bowl and cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming.</li>
                     <li>Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or until the pudding is set and completely chilled.</li>
                     <li>Serve chilled, optionally with whipped cream or chocolate shavings on top.</li>
