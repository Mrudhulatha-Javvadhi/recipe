                     <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                     <li>In a mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
                     <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                     <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
                     <li>Stir in the oats and raisins until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
                     <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them a few inches apart.</li>
                     <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
