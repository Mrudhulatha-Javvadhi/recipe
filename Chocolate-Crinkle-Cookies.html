                     <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, granulated sugar, and vegetable oil.</li>
                     <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                     <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
                     <li>Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                     <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                     <li>Shape the chilled dough into 1-inch balls and roll them in powdered sugar until coated.</li>
                     <li>Place the coated dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them a few inches apart.</li>
                     <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies have cracked on top and the edges are set.</li>
                     <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
